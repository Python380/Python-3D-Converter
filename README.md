# TriConvert
Software to convert 3D file types

## Usage

Run the following command: `python ./convert.py`. It will output the following:
```
python convert.py [FLAGS]

REQUIRED FLAGS:
    -i  Input file
    -o  Output file
```

## Currently supported formats
There are no formats that are currently truely supported. I hope this will change in the future.

## Partially supported formats
- `.obj` - WaveFront OBJ
- `.3mf` - 3D Manufacturing Format

## Formats to support next:
- `.stl` is next.

If you have any formats you would like to add or have me try to add, create an issue.

## Things that need to be done:
- clean up all of the code files
